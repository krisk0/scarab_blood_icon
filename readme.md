# Scarab blood icon

Changes icon for scarab blood trait.

## Motivation

Elder Kings modification version 0.15.1 has a minor defect: icons for unmourned blood and scarab blood traits look the same.

Both traits are useful, you will want to have them on all your dynasty members (at least on those who will serve on certain court positions, or own land, or be married to a land owner). It is very inconvenient that the two icons look the same.

## Technical requirements

* Crusader Kings version Crown 1.15.0.2.
* Elder Kings modification version 0.15.1.

## Installation

Install via **dowser.exe** as usual.

Or just replace one file of EK mod: **scarab_blood.dds**.
